Final burn to heliocentric Mars\u2013Earth orbit was performed after the second stage and payload cruised for 6 hours through the Van Allen belts. Later, Elon Musk tweeted that the third burn was successful, and JPL's HORIZONS system showed the second stage and payload in an orbit with an aphelion of 1.67 AU.
